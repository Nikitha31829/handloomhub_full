          Handlooms: The Heritage of Indian Craftsmanship
        </h2>
        <p className="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-neutral-300 mb-8">
          Handlooms are manually operated weaving systems used to create textiles with unmatched artistry and cultural value. Every handwoven fabric carries the identity of the artisan, the story of their region, and techniques passed down through generations. Unlike mass-produced textiles, handlooms emphasize precision, sustainability, and human skill.
